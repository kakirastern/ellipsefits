# ellipsefits

This is Python code for reading, processing, and plotting the isophotal
ellipse fits generated by the IRAF/STSDAS "ellipse" task (part of the
stsdas.analysis.isophote package)


## Requirements:
This should work under any recent version of Python 3; it also works
in Python 2.7.

It currently *cannot* read the standard (STSDAS TABLES) output table files generated by
"ellipse"; these tables should be converted to FITS tables using "tcopy" or to
text file using "tdump" (both of which are tasks in the STSDAS TABLES package).
The included IRAF script "doellipse.cl", which is a wrapper around the "ellipse" task,
will automatically generate both conversions.
